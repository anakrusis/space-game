# space-game

This is a little game about piloting a multi-purpose spaceplane. You can explore faraway planets, build new cities, or do side missions.

This game uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for rendering and is compatible with many web browsers. It runs fine in Chrome/Chromium and Firefox (Firefox users may want to turn down the graphics settings though). It uses localStorage for save files-- if you are going to clear site data, make sure to export/backup your world files!

There isn't much to see right now, but you can always come back later and see how things have changed! I hope you have fun!
